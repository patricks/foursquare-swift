foursquare-swift
================

A Foursquare client for OS X written in Swift

This project is my first Swift application. It started as a simple learning application. Maybe there will be more features later.

There is a FoursquareExample.plist file, you have to rename/copy it to Foursquare.plist and insert you credentials there.

TODO:
-----

* OAuth2 integration
* Checkin feature
